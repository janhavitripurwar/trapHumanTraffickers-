### Abstract
Human trafficking is a group of crimes involving trafficking in person of men, women and children for sexual exploitation or for financial gains or other exploitation of trafficked persons. According to government data, every eighth minute, a child goes missing (read. trafficked) in India. So have you ever thought how scarcely it may affect our society, if it is not restrained?

Our team has come out with one of the possible solutions to reduce human trafficking, user will have a mobile application which through conversations between user and other person (human trafficker) will detect the severity of the situation and inform 3 trusted people through a sms/call according to the data taken from user. These conversations will be fed to a ml model which will detect whether the situation severe or not.
